          We are a team that validates emails and phones using social networks
          for the past 3 years. Previously, we did it manually and it took from
          3 weeks to a year, but at the moment it takes from us only 15 minutes
          to check 1 000 000 email addresses.

          Our service will be useful to those who are working every day to
          increase conversion in email mailings and want to decrease bounce
          rate. We will also be useful to those who want to know who is behind
          that email or phone in order to save their time and money.
