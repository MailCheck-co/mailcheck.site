### Where do you get the data for verification?

We take the data from public sources, system search, social networks, and open databases available online.

### What social networks do you use for validation?

We use - Google, Gravatar, Linkedin, Facebook, etc.

### What is your difference from the competitors?

The main difference from our competitors is that we do not use only the automatic search and validation but we provide manual moderation, so we use all the power of social networks and search engines for more in-depth validation.

### What is your trial?

We let our customers potentially feel the difference by verifying 10 emails FOR FREE without adding a payment method and increase the number of verifications up to 100 emails with the payment method added.

### How does Mailcheck work?

Mailcheck is one place where you can validate all of your emails. Besides the plans we offer, we also don't set the limits for email validations on paid plans, while processing an overcharge. Imagine you have a list of 1200 emails and currently purchased a "PRO" plan. Since the PRO plan includes 1000 emails, we will do 200 email validation and at the end of the billing cycle will inform about the overcharge. Overuse charge: $0.005 for the PRO plan For more please visit [dashboard/payment_plans](https://app.mailcheck.co/dashboard/payment_plans) or [contact our support team](mailto:support+faq@mailcheck.co)

### What is the overuse charge?

Since Mailcheck doesn't set any limits for the verification we allow our clients under the paid subscriptions to verify as many emails as they can, overuse charge applies when the plan limited was used up. For example, the overuse charge for the PRO = $0.005 Agency = $0.004 Enterprise = $0.003 The bigger plan you choose the lower overuse charge can be

### Can I delete my files?

In the Mailcheck we allow our clients to hide their data, just follow the link [https://app.mailcheck.co/dashboard/my_files](https://app.mailcheck.co/dashboard/my_files) and choose "X" sign next to each file

### How can I cancel my subscription?

In order to cancel a subscription, please [contact our support team](mailto:support+faq@mailcheck.co).

### I was charged more than my plan costs

Mailcheck works on a subscription basis and if you have any of the paid plans (PRO, AGENCY, ENTERPRISE, LEGENDARY) so you are able to verify more emails than you have according to your plan, to receive more detailed information, please [contact our support team](mailto:support+faq@mailcheck.co)

### Why I can't see a dark mode option on my account?

We apply Dark Mode only for those users who have purchased paid plans and planning to develop more features

It depends but usually takes around 20min-60min just because our innovative technology allows making in-depth validation and run the data through multiply sources making sure we give the most accurate answer.
