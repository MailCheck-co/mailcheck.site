One of the most frustrating things that can happen when managing an email list is discovering that you have duplicate entries. Not only is it a waste of space in your list, but it can also cost you money if you’re using an email validation service that charges per entry.

Thankfully, [Mailcheck.co](/) has a solution for this problem. With [Mailcheck.co](/), you don’t have to worry about paying for duplicates in your list. This means that if you have multiple entries for the same email address, you won’t be charged for each one.

![Mailcheck](./img1.png?format=jpg&width=880)

Displaying -1 in the results is an indication of a duplicate email within the same file. When you upload a file for processing, [Mailcheck.co](/) identifies and flags any duplicate emails it detects. This allows you to easily identify and manage duplicate entries within your email list.

The presence of -1 signifies that the particular email address already exists elsewhere in the same file. This is useful in situations where you want to ensure that your email list is free from duplicate entries, which can lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies in your marketing campaigns.

In addition to duplicate emails, [Mailcheck.co](/) also provides a comprehensive analysis of your email data, flagging any irrelevant or non-email-related entries.

By not charging any credits for such entries, [Mailcheck.co](/) ensures that you only pay for the actual email validation services you need.

The -1 indicator serves as a helpful criterion to manage duplicate emails within a file and distinguish them from non-email entries. It allows you to easily identify and remove duplicates, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of your email list. Moreover, by not deducting any credits for non-email entries, [Mailcheck.co](/) ensures that you get the most value out of your email validation process.

This feature not only saves you money, but also helps to keep your email list organized and efficient. You can easily merge duplicate entries and ensure that your list is streamlined and up to date.

## 9\. Specify the delimiter manually

![Mailcheck](./img6.png?format=jpg&width=880)

Specify the delimiter manually for accurate data parsing. When working with .csv files, it’s essential to ensure that the fields are correctly separated by the appropriate delimiter. In some cases, the table may not be displayed correctly due to an incorrect or unrecognized delimiter.

In the [Mailcheck.co](/) interface, you have the option to manually select or enter the delimiter that is used in your .csv file. This allows you to accurately parse the data and ensure that it is properly processed by the system.

To determine the correct delimiter for your file, you don’t have to go through the hassle of manually inspecting the document. With [Mailcheck.co](/), we’ve simplified the process for you. When previewing your file in the email, if it looks readable and the columns are properly aligned, then you have likely chosen the right delimiter. Look for the character that separates the fields within each row. Common delimiters include commas (,), semicolons (;), tabs (\t), or pipes (|).

However, in some cases, the preview may not provide a clear indication of the delimiter. If you are unable to identify the correct delimiter through the preview, then you can refer to the actual file. Open the file using a text editor, such as Excel, and examine the content. The delimiter character will be visible as the character that separates the fields within each row.

Once you have identified the delimiter character, you can conveniently specify it in the [Mailcheck.co](/) interface during the file upload process. This ensures that the system accurately parses the data, maintaining the integrity of your email list and facilitating precise email validation.

By manually selecting or entering the delimiter, you have full control over how your data is parsed and can ensure that the table is displayed correctly within [Mailcheck.co](/). This feature enhances the accuracy and reliability of the data processing, making it easier for you to work with your .csv files and extract valuable insights from your data.

Take advantage of the manual delimiter specification feature in [Mailcheck.co](/) to ensure seamless data parsing and accurate processing of your .csv files.

## 10\. Transfer validated data right into the original file with no rows mismatch

Users who validate emails on the go often face the problem of parsing database table rows, as not all validators can provide parsing of name, address, or company rows.

1\. Most validators take the email as a unit data and remove the rest of the data from the tables.

2\. [Mailcheck.co](/) processes the database uploaded to the “Upload” section and deletes all other details except for the email for fast data processing, which is why the output contains the “Email column” from the original import. Within minutes, depending on the file size, the user has access to the validated data, which includes the email and its corresponding trust score.

You can look at the screenshot below

![Mailcheck](./img7.png?format=jpg&width=880)

3\. Users can copy the columns from the email and trust report and select the entire database within two columns.

![Mailcheck](./img8.png?format=jpg&width=880)

4\. The original file remains unchanged as much as possible, making it easy for users to merge their validated data with the original file.

![Mailcheck](./img9.png?format=jpg&width=880)

5\. It is important to remember that the email checker system recommends using emails with a 50-100% trust score, as they are more likely to reach the corresponding user’s mailbox.

6\. Streamline Data Integration: Seamlessly Paste Verified Email Columns into Your Original File.

7\. Preserve Data Integrity: Mailcheck Ensures Original File Consistency for Hassle-Free Data Merging.

8\. Swift Data Merge: Effortlessly Combine All Data with Your Original File in Less Than a Minute. Look below:

P.S. [Mailcheck.co](/) does not take credits for validating duplicate or broken syntax emails, and the validated data can be transferred directly to the original file with no row mismatch.

## 11\. Set up an Email API

Setting up an Email API is a crucial step in enhancing the functionality and security of your online platforms. By integrating the Email API provided by [Mailcheck.co](/), you can seamlessly incorporate a contact form, registration, and login processes while ensuring effective filtering to determine which contacts are allowed and which ones are not.
