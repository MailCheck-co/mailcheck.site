However, there are some predictable important things, such as unique content, sweet up-to-dated design and a CTA that convince you to make the purchase ASAP. Make sure you focus on these email marketing parts, because not considering them is a huge mistake. One from that a lot of marketers keep repeating.

In the recent email survey, organized by Adobe, we spotted a very interesting detail. This study shows, that about 10% of recipients really mention when there is any call to action or “Buy button” in the email. And they feel disappointed because of that. Are you asking yourself how is it possible? It is the marketing email! A “Buy” button or another CTA is MUST! We asked ourselves, too. That’s an astounding mistake, and we think it’s worth sharing.

The survey tries to understand subscribers behavior, and the facts it reveals are inspiring, to say the least. There is a lot we can learn from it, so let’s start.

## Not building your own database

First of all, you need to have some people you will write to. Start with a list with your actual audience and grow from there. There a lot of ways how you can find new subscribers: you can offer to sign up for your newsletter on your website, use the CTA button on social media, to import contacts from Linkedin and similar sources.

[In no case do not buy an email list, it will harm your reputation and totally doesn’t worth the efforts](/blog/want-to-buy-an-email-list-we-have-6-reasons-not-to).

That’s why missing a call-to-action is a big mistake and you can pay the high price for it. Your prospects might never return to that letter, in fact they may even unsubscribe from your newsletters

## Relying on quantity

At the start of any business, it’s owner and marketers are extremely happy with each new subscriber. But the farther, the more it becomes clear that the quantity is not the point. You may have a list with a dozen thousands of subscribers, but only a few of them bring you money. That’s the biggest problem of newbies - they rely on quantity, not quality. And this mistake can be crucial.

## Not paying attention

Surely it takes effort to perfect. You need something more than email verification to tackle this issue. Special marketing tools and tactics will help you to identify your customers’ preferences. While fine-tuning your communication, invest your resources and time in personalization. It definitely worth it!

- sending emails to a messy list, instead of check email list valid and install an email validation API on sign up forms;
- creating messages that don’t adopted for mobile screens;
- over-selling copy, instead of message that resonates with your subscribers.
